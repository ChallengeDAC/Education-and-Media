## Project Overview

Neutroswap is an automated market-maker (AMM) on the EOS EVM blockchain that is community-driven and offers the low fees for swapping assets. Neutroswap's staking and yield farming rewards are among the highest in the EOS EVM ecosystem, attracting those seeking profitable returns on their assets. Our team decides to focus more towards bringing liquidity to EOS EVM chain more. It will enable more users, projects and exposure coming to EOS EVM due to TVL increase and project development.

### Overview

- **Name:** Neutroswap
- **Brief Description:** A community-driven interconnected tokenomics ecosystem with burn and yield booster mechanism
- **Relationship to EOS Network / Antelope:** Our app brings liquidity to EOS EVM attracting more projects and users to use the chain.
- **Reason for Interest:** Capital efficiency, impermanent loss mitigation, higher fee rewards, reduced slippage, improved price discovery for our app users.

### Project Details

We have successfully launched $NEUTRO token alongside our Neutroswap V2:

1. The first DApp that reached $1,000,000 in TVL
2. The first EOS EVM token listed on Coingecko
3. The first working app on EOS EVM and has active users.
4. Bring more than 2000+ transactions on average per day since launch.
5. Bring $150,000+ volume daily accross Neutroswap V2 pool.
6. The first project that triggers influencers to look at EOS EVM.
7. $NEUTRO all-time price $0.41
8. [Burned 98% of max supply](https://twitter.com/Neutroswap/status/1653759171664429056?s=20) (980,000,000 $NEUTRO)

We are shifting our focus to enhance the utility and value of the $NEUTRO token. Previously, it was primarily utilized for incentivizing users through Neutro Farms and Vaults. Our plan now includes introducing $xNEUTRO, a locked version of the token similar to $veCRV by Curve Finance. Additionally, we will implement various updates such as Plugins, a new distribution mechanism for protocol revenue, a deflationary mechanism, and spNFTs.

[**xNEUTRO**](https://docs.neutroswap.io/neutroswap-v2-coming-soon/xneutro-token)

$xNEUTRO will be non-transferable and act as our governance token. $xNEUTRO main utility is the ability for it to be allocated by users to our various [plugins](https://docs.neutroswap.io/neutroswap-v2-coming-soon/plugins) such as:

- [Dividends](https://docs.neutroswap.io/neutroswap-v2-coming-soon/plugins/dividends): Giving $xNEUTRO holders a portion of revenue generated by Neutroswap
- [Yield Multiplier](https://docs.neutroswap.io/neutroswap-v2-coming-soon/plugins/yield-multiplier): Boosting users' yield up to 2x
- [Launchpad](https://docs.neutroswap.io/neutroswap-v2-coming-soon/plugins/launchpad): Giving priority access to $xNEUTRO holders allocating to this plugin more exclusivity access to Neutroswap upcoming Launchpad

[**Staked Positions NFT (spNFTs)**](https://docs.neutroswap.io/neutroswap-v2-coming-soon/staked-positions-spnfts)

The upcoming mechanism will replace the existing Neutro Farms as they both serve similar purposes. The key distinction is that instead of solely depositing LP tokens into the Farms smart contract, users will receive spNFTs in exchange for their deposited LP tokens, making it tradeable.

[**Protocol Revenue Distribution**](https://docs.neutroswap.io/neutroswap-v2-coming-soon/protocol-revenue)

The protocol-generated revenue will be distributed as follows:

- 60% is allocated to Liquidity Providers in the form of LP tokens.
- 22.5% is distributed as dividends to $xNEUTRO holders.
- 12.5% is dedicated to the buyback and burn of $NEUTRO tokens.
- 5% is allocated to the Core Contributors' funds.

The Core Contributors funds will be solely utilized to cover operational expenses. At the end of each month, any remaining unused amount will be reallocated at the team's discretion, either towards Dividends or for Buyback and Burn purposes.

[**Deflationary Mechanism**](https://docs.neutroswap.io/neutroswap-v2-coming-soon/deflationary-mechanism)

We applied a few mechanism that will increase the buying pressure of $NEUTRO with the aim of making it for attractive for future investors, while increasing value for $NEUTRO holders.

- Buyback and Burn: A portion of the protocol revenues is allocated towards the buyback and burn of $NEUTRO tokens, creating persistent buying pressure on the token.
- xNEUTRO Reedem: During the [redeem of $xNEUTRO to $NEUTRO](https://docs.neutroswap.io/neutroswap-v2-coming-soon/xneutro-token/convert-redeem#redeeming-xneutro-greater-than-neutro), if the vesting duration is not set to the maximum, the xNEUTRO:NEUTRO ratio will be adjusted to a value below 1:1, ranging from 1:0.5 as the minimum. Any surplus $NEUTRO obtained during this process will be automatically burned.
- xNEUTRO Deallocation: When users deallocate $xNEUTRO from a Plugin, a deallocation tax is imposed, typically set at 0.5%. This tax may vary across contracts. Furthermore, the corresponding amount of $NEUTRO will be automatically burned as a result of the deallocation process.

### Ecosystem Fit

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

- Who is your target audience (chain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?

  Farmers, DeFi users, crypto users in general, traders

- What need(s) does your project meet?

  Neutroswap will be the pioneering project on EOS EVM to introduce advanced tokenomics, which has the potential to ignite competition from other projects. Through healthy competition, we aim to foster greater innovation within the DeFi ecosystem on EOS EVM.

- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOS Network / Antelope ecosystem?

  Currently, there are no projects offering similar features and complex tokenomics as our planned implementation for Neutroswap. However, as mentioned before, there is the possibility of Noahswap and Frogge following suit and introducing similar functionalities on EOS EVM.

## Future Plans

Upon implementing all the aforementioned updates, we anticipate a notable surge in Neutroswap users, aligning with the growth of EOS EVM users and potential developers. Furthermore, we have strategic plans to intensify our business development endeavors by seeking new partnerships that will benefit both Neutroswap and the EOS EVM ecosystem as a whole.

## Additional Information

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?** EOS Network Foundation Twitter / personal recommendation

As we look to the future of Neutroswap and EOS EVM, we believe that a grant to bring liquidity to the platform is essential. We've been proud to build Neutroswap without raising any investment from VC firms, and we're hopeful that ENF will see the value in our work and provide the support we need to continue to grow and innovate on EOS EVM.

We have done our best to trigger the initial wave of EOS EVM by becoming:

1. The first DApp that reached $1,000,000 in TVL
2. The first EOS EVM token listed on Coingecko
3. The first working app on EOS EVM and has active users.
4. Bring more than 2000+ transactions on average per day since launch
5. Bring $150,000+ volume daily accross Neutroswap V2 DEX
6. The first project that triggers influencers to look at EOS EVM

By supporting Neutroswap as a catalyst project, ENF can help to attract the attention of other EVM developers and encourage them to build on EOS EVM. This can lead to an influx of proposals seeking grants, which would be a welcome problem for ENF to have. However, the most important thing is to generate traction, volume, TVL, and attract more users, especially builders, to the EOS EVM ecosystem. With ENF's support, we can continue to lead the charge and set the standard for innovation and growth in EOS EVM.

Thank you for considering our proposal
