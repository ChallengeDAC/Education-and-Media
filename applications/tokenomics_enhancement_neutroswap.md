### New tokenomics

We are shifting our focus to enhance the utility and value of the $NEUTRO token. Previously, it was primarily utilized for incentivizing users through Neutro Farms and Vaults. Our plan now includes introducing $xNEUTRO, a locked version of the token similar to $veCRV by Curve Finance. Additionally, we will implement various updates such as Plugins, a new distribution mechanism for protocol revenue, a deflationary mechanism, and spNFTs.

![Neutroswap V2 Plugins](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1mk7WXKT4kBm8e272KN55_GdxFv1OANlb)  

#### [**1. xNEUTRO**](https://docs.neutroswap.io/neutroswap-v2-coming-soon/xneutro-token)

$xNEUTRO will be non-transferable and act as our governance token. $xNEUTRO main utility is the ability for it to be allocated by users to our various [plugins](https://docs.neutroswap.io/neutroswap-v2-coming-soon/plugins) such as:

- [Dividends](https://docs.neutroswap.io/neutroswap-v2-coming-soon/plugins/dividends): Giving $xNEUTRO holders a portion of revenue generated by Neutroswap
- [Yield Multiplier](https://docs.neutroswap.io/neutroswap-v2-coming-soon/plugins/yield-multiplier): Boosting users' yield up to 2x
- [Launchpad](https://docs.neutroswap.io/neutroswap-v2-coming-soon/plugins/launchpad): Giving priority access to $xNEUTRO holders allocating to this plugin more exclusivity access to Neutroswap upcoming Launchpad

#### [**2. Staked Positions NFT (spNFTs)**](https://docs.neutroswap.io/neutroswap-v2-coming-soon/staked-positions-spnfts)

The upcoming mechanism will replace the existing Neutro Farms as they both serve similar purposes. The key distinction is that instead of solely depositing LP tokens into the Farms smart contract, users will receive spNFTs in exchange for their deposited LP tokens, making it tradeable.

Users have the opportunity to mint staked positions NFT (spNFTs) by wrapping Neutroswap LP tokens, which involves depositing them into the respective contract.

This action transfers the deposit to a designated NFTPool contract, resulting in the issuance of spNFTs. Consider this NFT as a deposit receipt, confirming the ownership of the staked position.

The ownership of the spNFTs acts as the sole authorization for a user to withdraw the corresponding funds, irrespective of the entity utilizing them. Therefore, the owner of the spNFT is effectively the rightful owner of the associated LPs, even if they were not the initial depositor.

spNFTs go beyond being mere receipts; they serve as replacements for traditional yield-generating farms commonly found in DeFi protocols. Additionally, spNFTs provide an additional layer of features that unlock unlimited opportunities and potential extensions, offering a myriad of possibilities:

#### [**3. Yield Farming**](https://docs.neutroswap.io/neutroswap-v2-coming-soon/staked-positions-spnfts/yield-farming)

The primary objective of staked positions in the form of spNFTs is to replace conventional yield farming mechanisms and receive incentives provided by Neutroswap. However, these staked positions offer a versatile range of uses beyond this initial purpose.

1. Yield-bearing NFTs: From a user's perspective, the mechanics of Neutroswap's spNFTs bear resemblances to regular DeFi farms. However, in contrast to allocating rewards solely to traditional farms, Neutroswap's Master contract distributes incentives to all staking positions associated with team-defined selected wrapped LPs. This approach ensures that incentives are widely distributed across the ecosystem.

2. Rewards: Neutroswap incentives are provided in the form of dual rewards, where eligible wrapped Neutroswap LPs enable their corresponding staked positions to receive both $NEUTRO and xNEUTRO rewards. The distribution ratio of these rewards varies for each asset, with the default allocation set to 80% $xNEUTRO / 20% $NEUTRO.

3. Yield multipliers: There are two methods to enhance returns from yield-generating staked positions: utilizing locks or the Yield Multiplier plugin. The specific values of these enhancements vary based on the staked asset, ranging from 0% to 150% (x1 to x2.5), although the default is typically set at 100% (x2). By summing these two multipliers, the total multiplier for the position is determined. Each pool will have its own maximum boost, with a default cap of 200% (x3) and an absolute cap of 250% (x3.5). These parameters are applied within the Neutroswap ecosystem.


#### [**4. Protocol Revenue Distribution**](https://docs.neutroswap.io/neutroswap-v2-coming-soon/protocol-revenue)

![Protocol Revenue Distribution](https://1194041802-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fen8htS8yWPtDJdaEljt1%2Fuploads%2FR5Sc2oApBRBbTOTG3zaq%2Fpurple%20gradient%20pie%20chart%20graph.png?alt=media&token=c7ae361e-b2b3-4b21-a82f-266ee5456b6c)

The protocol-generated revenue will be distributed as follows:

- 60% is allocated to Liquidity Providers in the form of LP tokens.
- 22.5% is distributed as dividends to $xNEUTRO holders.
- 12.5% is dedicated to the buyback and burn of $NEUTRO tokens.
- 5% is allocated to the Core Contributors' funds.

The Core Contributors funds will be solely utilized to cover operational expenses. At the end of each month, any remaining unused amount will be reallocated at the team's discretion, either towards Dividends or for Buyback and Burn purposes.

#### [**5. Deflationary Mechanism**](https://docs.neutroswap.io/neutroswap-v2-coming-soon/deflationary-mechanism)

We applied a few mechanism that will increase the buying pressure of $NEUTRO with the aim of making it for attractive for future investors, while increasing value for $NEUTRO holders.

- Buyback and Burn: A portion of the protocol revenues is allocated towards the buyback and burn of $NEUTRO tokens, creating persistent buying pressure on the token.
- xNEUTRO Reedem: During the [redeem of $xNEUTRO to $NEUTRO](https://docs.neutroswap.io/neutroswap-v2-coming-soon/xneutro-token/convert-redeem#redeeming-xneutro-greater-than-neutro), if the vesting duration is not set to the maximum, the xNEUTRO:NEUTRO ratio will be adjusted to a value below 1:1, ranging from 1:0.5 as the minimum. Any surplus $NEUTRO obtained during this process will be automatically burned.
Let's take an example to illustrate this process: 
If a user chooses to redeem 1000 $xNEUTRO with the minimum vesting duration of 15 days, they will receive a ratio of 1:0.5, resulting in 500 $NEUTRO. Consequently, a total of 1000 - 500 = 500 $NEUTRO will be burned throughout the redemption process.

- xNEUTRO Deallocation: When users deallocate $xNEUTRO from a Plugin, a deallocation tax is imposed, typically set at 0.5%. This tax may vary across contracts. Furthermore, the corresponding amount of $NEUTRO will be automatically burned as a result of the deallocation process.

### Ecosystem Fit

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
Currently, EOS EVM needs more TVL to achieve organic exposure and attract new users. That's why we're thrilled to have already seen significant growth since our launch. But we're not stopping there. Our team is committed to further strengthening EOS EVM by providing even more value through our new tokenomics. With $xNEUTRO, we're confident that we can continue to drive growth and make EOS EVM an even more vibrant and successful ecosystem

- Who is your target audience (chain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?

  Farmers, DeFi users, crypto users in general, traders

- What need(s) does your project meet?

  Neutroswap will be the pioneering project on EOS EVM to introduce advanced tokenomics, which has the potential to ignite competition from other projects. Through healthy competition, we aim to foster greater innovation within the DeFi ecosystem on EOS EVM.

- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOS Network / Antelope ecosystem?

  Currently, there are no projects offering similar features and complex tokenomics as our planned implementation for Neutroswap. However, as mentioned before, there is the possibility of Noahswap and Frogge following suit and introducing similar functionalities on EOS EVM.

## Future Plans

Upon implementing all the aforementioned updates, we anticipate a notable surge in Neutroswap users, aligning with the growth of EOS EVM users and potential developers. Furthermore, we have strategic plans to intensify our business development endeavors by seeking new partnerships that will benefit both Neutroswap and the EOS EVM ecosystem as a whole.

## Additional Information

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?** EOS Network Foundation Twitter / personal recommendation

As we look to the future of Neutroswap and EOS EVM, we believe that a grant to bring liquidity to the platform is essential. We've been proud to build Neutroswap without raising any investment from VC firms, and we're hopeful that ENF will see the value in our work and provide the support we need to continue to grow and innovate on EOS EVM.

We have done our best to trigger the initial wave of EOS EVM by becoming:
1. The first DApp that reached $1,500,000 in TVL in EOS EVM
2. The first EOS EVM token listed on best platforms:
- [Debank](https://debank.com/protocols/eos_neutroswap/assets)
- [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/price/neutroswap)
- [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/neutroswap)
- [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/dexscan/networks/eos-evm/)
- [GeckoTerminal](https://www.geckoterminal.com/eos-evm/pools/0xb3fb2548287bcadd5a045270b3182c1fc6318684)
- [DappRadar](https://dappradar.com/dapp/neutroswap)
- [Ave.ai](https://ave.ai/token/0xf4bd487a8190211e62925435963d996b59a860c0-eos?from=Default) 
3. The first working app on EOS EVM and has active users.
4. Bring more than 7500+ transactions on average per day since launch.
5. Bring $150,000+ volume daily accross Neutroswap pool.
6. The first project that triggers influencers to look at EOS EVM.
7. $NEUTRO all-time price $0.41
8. [Burned 98% of max supply](https://twitter.com/Neutroswap/status/1653759171664429056?s=20) (980,000,000 $NEUTRO)

By supporting Neutroswap as a catalyst project, ENF can help to attract the attention of other EVM developers and encourage them to build on EOS EVM. This can lead to an influx of proposals seeking grants, which would be a welcome problem for ENF to have. However, the most important thing is to generate traction, volume, TVL, and attract more users, especially builders, to the EOS EVM ecosystem. With ENF's support, we can continue to lead the charge and set the standard for innovation and growth in EOS EVM.

Thank you for considering our proposal
