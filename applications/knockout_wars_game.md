## Project Overview

This is a proposal to build & launch Knockout Wars Game on EOS EVM


### Overview

- **Name:** Knockout Wars, a Mobile Multiplayer Fireball Fighting Game
- **Brief Description:** We want to be the 1st Mobile Skill based fighting game on EOS EVM that is set up for mass adoption.

We expect to achieve 100,000-125,000 YouTube views promoting our game tournaments with EOS EVM being the sponsor and receiving shout outs from the Influencers, generating much needed awareness of EOS EVM in the social space.

We want to introduce our community to EOS (95K on Twitter & 22K on TG & 10K on YouTube)

We want to grow our current MAU (closed beta) from 1,000 to 10,000 (10X increase) resulting in 100,000 games showcasing the EOS EVM branding inside the game.
All the above will result in EOS EVM gaining new exposure to new gaming communities.  
- **Relationship to EOS Network / Antelope:** Enhance the EOS Gamefi ecosystem via EOS EVM 
- **Reason for Interest:** I have been a member of the EOS community since 2018. Unfortunately, due to the instability caused by Block One I decided to launch the project on BSC. Now that we as a community have taken over from Block One and after discussing with Yves La Rose, I want to do my bit to contribute towards making Gamefi on EOS EVM flourish and ultimately highlight the exceptional technology underlying the EOS blockchain.


### Project Details

GAMI is an Influencer centric Web3 gaming studio set-up for onboarding the next 100 million gamers. 

Our debut game ‘Knockout Wars’ <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gami.knockoutwars> is a Mobile Multiplayer Fireball Fighting Game inspired by Street Fighter & Dodgeball. Currently in closed beta testing with the community.


Most Web3 games are finding it difficult to gain mass adoption. 

We believe the solutions are as follows: 

1. Remove Web3 wallet barrier

Gamers are alienated when required to adopt a Web3 wallet to play games, this becomes a barrier to mass adoption. Our games use social logins for all players, allowing them to adopt Web3 at their own pace.

2. Align incentives correctly for mass adoption

Web3 gaming incentives are misaligned, as they focus on paying the gamer and not the promoter. We feel gamers should be rewarded with a fun experience, and promoters (influencers) should be rewarded financially.

Our innovative #Influence&Earn program, incentivises Influencers to host captivating Tournaments, attracting audiences and boosting engagement, opening the doors to mass adoption. 

3. Sustainable economy

Web3 games that require more paying users to sustain the Play2Earn economy are designed to fail, similar to pyramid schemes. Our economy uses NFT sales and sponsorship revenue to bring new money into the ecosystem to fund our onboarding strategy powered by our innovative #Influence&Earn program, making it a sustainable economy setup for mass adoption.

Note: Our solidity smart contracts will be open source but our unity game will not be open source.
