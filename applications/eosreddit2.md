## Project Overview
Educate and inform the world of cryptocurrencies about the latest events on EOS and its technological improvements, generate active use of Reddit by promoting the adoption of EOS, promoting the different content of interest to users on Reddit and Facebook.

### Overview

- **Name:** EOS VISION x REDDIT AND FACEBOOK
- **Brief Description:** Welcome to EOS REDDIT 2.0, the new stage of EOS REDDIT, where we will be able to turn the old, lonely and depressed Reddit into a new way of reading the news and giving constructive opinions. Our trained team prepares to work on 3 Fundamental Pillars, offering a new face to Reddit, as well as providing new alternatives and attention to users with a misconception of EOS. Let's get ready to interact in all of Reddit in a respectful way, not only in the official EOS Reddit, trying to give a good marketing to what is being developed in EOS, reaching other Subreddits informing in a simple way developments, processes, improvements and projects that we have within the ecosystem.
- **Relationship to EOSIO:** We prepare to promote the EOS and EOSIO community in the best possible way, with good marketing, as well as to demonstrate that the work that is done together between the blockchains has borne fruit and momentum to EOSIO. Reddit has an extensive number of users who will not hesitate to look at the information related to EOS AND EOSIO.
- **Reason for Interest:** EOS VISION proposes to support the EOS community on Reddit, which has 97.7k members, is being one of the largest EOS communities, it is also the one with the most FUD of all EOS, since a couple of years, It has been a bit abandoned, and has been recovering thanks to the team of EOS SUPPORT and EOS BEES. We have seen how necessary and important this social network can be to attract both new users and new projects, so we propose to support Reddit.

### Project Details

Our Mission Educate and inform the crypto world about the most recent events on EOS and its technological improvements, generate active use of Reddit and Facebook, promote the adoption of EOS and encourage the arrival of more users to these networks by promoting different content of interest . to all the people on Reddit and Facebook and thus connect these networks with others of great importance such as Discord, Telegram etc.

Projects Secondary Objectives: Weekly and daily bulletins, extremely important information announcements. Podcasts with the EOS community, as well as special videos about using different dApps or projects. General support to the different EOS projects. Informative courses for new users in EOS. Reports, summaries and translations of the work carried out in EOS VISION.

Aimed at resolving current issues such as Interacting and correcting misconceptions about EOS on social media, especially the social media we will be focusing on (Facebook and Reddit), which have been based on price, as well as respectfully encouraging users to express their opinions and negative aspects dedicated to FUD to show and encourage them to consult the new stage of EOS, the new opportunities and the different options that have been developed on the Network.

Documentation of basic components, protocols, architecture, etc. to implement. We intend to use the reports, news, videos and other RELEVANT information found in the EOS COMMUNITY, and thus spread it on the social networks of Reddit and Facebook. Currently we use ENF Networks on Reddit and we bring the information punctually from the main source of information, his blog and twitter.

What your project is not or will not provide or implement We will support Reddit, but it will not be owned by us, EOS REDDIT and EOS Facebook are owned by the community and anyone can provide their services.
This is a place for you to manage expectations and clarify any limitations that may not be obvious.

    PILLARS OF THE REDDIT VISION Updated based on the needs of the community.

1. Encourage users to React to Publications: At this stage we need users to be able to read the information and react to it, EOS VISION will focus on working to receive more reactions on the different networks as well as more comments on them.

2.Moderation and Growth of Networks and Users: Encourage more people to join social networks, as well as moderate them extensively and widely, Reddit is one of the main Spammer entries into the ecosystem and we are ready to kill it. this.

3. Growth of the ENF Official account on Reddit: Reddit already has the support of the ENF and we plan to continue promoting their networks. These months Reddit and Facebook have had a better and more complete information area thanks to the information development created by the NFE core team. We hope soon to be able to continue to grow this account and be fully verifiable.

### Ecosystem Fit

 • Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem? Our project is in Ecosystem Growth, we hope to give good support to both EOS and projects, on Reddit and Facebook.
 
 • Who is your target audience (chain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)? Our hearing is based on: Journalists crypto users. New users on EOS and Antelope.
 
 • What need(s) does your project meet? A new opportunity for reddit and facebook and using these networks that have many users are given the opportunity to learn more about EOS, its dApps, ecosystem and development in these social networks and show what is being created.
 
 • Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOSIO ecosystem?
 ◦ If so, how is your project different?
 ◦ If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems? Yes, currently some of the users within EOS post on Reddit, but not daily, EOS NATION and EOS SUPPORT post important details whenever needed. The difference of our proposal is that we intend to have Reddit active daily, with any relevant information.

## Development Status

> If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:

- links to improvement proposals or [RFPs](https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/grant-framework/tree/main/docs/rfps) (requests for proposal),
- academic publications relevant to the problem,
- links to your research diary, blog posts, articles, forum discussions or open GitHub issues,
- references to conversations you might have had related to this project with anyone from the EOS Network Foundation,
- previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes.

## Development Roadmap

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to the EOS ecosystem. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0c are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on someone else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**
